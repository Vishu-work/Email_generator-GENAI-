Subject: Transaction Failed for Withdrawal

Dear Support Team at Groww,

I am writing to report a failed transaction for the withdrawal of sale proceeds from my Groww account. I recently sold some stocks that I had bought earlier on Groww, but upon attempting to withdraw the money, the transaction failed. Unfortunately, the funds do not appear in my bank account or within my Groww account. 

I would be grateful if you could look into the matter and provide me with information on why the transaction failed and how I can resolve this issue. 

Thank you in advance for your assistance. 

Kind Regards, 

[Your Name]

Please let me know if there is any other information or context I can provide to assist you with this matter.
